To build test client run makefile with default target, or CClient, change to newly made bin directory.
Set load path to find Fortran calling .so and call ./CClient.

E.g.    
	make
	... <build output>
	cd bin
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`realpath .`
	./CClient
	... <usage reminder>


A sample command line might look like:
	./CClient 03 04 2021 23.00 37.8 -75 10 800 80
